The presentation is based on the  HPC-Ghent [tutorial](
http://users.ugent.be/~kehoste/hpcugent-intro-20171110.pdf) made by HPC administrators
and general HPC manual  (choose [„linux”](http://hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs/pdf/intro-HPC-linux-gent.pdf) with [„windows”](http://hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs/pdf/intro-HPC-windows-gent.pdf) or [„mac”](http://hpcugent.github.io/vsc_user_docs/pdf/intro-HPC-linux-gent.pdf) to get tutorial fo your OS) which I higly recommend to read/consult.


I used the  information from the following  chapters:

+ 1/ Introduction to HPC
+ 2/ Getting an HPC Account
+ 3/ Connecting to the HPC
+ 4/ Running batch jobs
+ 6/ Running  jobs  with  input/output data


Remember, at the end of manual you could find HPC Quick Reference Guide with  most needed HPC and linux command in one place.
